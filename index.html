        <h3>Our Mission Statement</h3>
        <p class="about-mission">
          People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is the largest
          animal rights organization in the world, and PETA entities have more
          than 9 million members and supporters globally. PETA opposes
          speciesism, a human-supremacist worldview, and focuses its attention
          on the four areas in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the
          most intensely for the longest periods of time: in laboratories, in
          the food industry, in the clothing trade, and in the entertainment
          business. We also work on a variety of other issues, including the
          cruel killing of rodents, birds, and other animals who are often
          considered “pests” as well as cruelty to domesticated animals. PETA
          works through public education, investigative newsgathering and
          reporting, research, animal rescue, legislation, special events,
          celebrity involvement, and protest campaigns.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p class="about-story">
          PETA was founded in 1980 and is dedicated to establishing and
          defending the rights of all animals. PETA operates under the simple
          principle that animals are not ours to experiment on, eat, wear, use
          for entertainment, or abuse in any other way. PETA informs
          policymakers and the public about animal abuse and promotes kind
          treatment of animals. PETA is an international nonprofit charitable
          organization based in Norfolk, Virginia, with entities worldwide. PETA
          believes that animals have rights and deserve to have their best
          interests taken into consideration, regardless of whether they are
          useful to humans. Like you, they are capable of suffering and have an
          interest in leading their own lives. The very heart of all of PETA’s
          actions is the idea that it is the right of all beings—human and
          nonhuman alike—to be free from harm. Our world is plagued with many
          serious problems, all of which deserve our attention. Cruelty to
          animals is one of them. We believe that all people should try to stop
          animal abuse whenever and wherever they can. Since 1980, PETA has
          campaigned to establish a global society in which humans consider the
          needs of what Henry Beston, noted American writer and naturalist of
          the mid-20th century, so beautifully called “the other nations.” We
          uphold the rights of individual animals to be respected. For most,
          that means simply leaving them alone. PETA opposes speciesism, a
          human-supremacist worldview, and focuses its attention on the four
          areas in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the most
          intensely for the longest periods of time: in laboratories, in the
          food industry, in the clothing trade, and in the entertainment
          business. We also work on a variety of other issues, including the
          cruel killing of rodents, birds, and other animals who are often
          considered “pests” as well as cruelty to domesticated animals. In
          today’s world of virtually unlimited choices, animal exploitation is
          simply unacceptable. We can eat better, educate ourselves better,
          clothe ourselves better, and entertain ourselves better without
          torturing and killing animals. We have the power to spare animals
          excruciating pain by making better choices about the food we eat, the
          things we buy, and the activities we support.

          Apple saved my business. I wish I would have thought of it first. We
          can't understand how we've been living without apple. Apple was the
          best investment I ever made.
