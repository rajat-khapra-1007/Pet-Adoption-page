      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <h3>Our Mission Statement</h3>
      <p class="about-mission">
        People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is the largest animal
        rights organization in the world, and PETA entities have more than 9
        million members and supporters globally. PETA opposes speciesism, a
        human-supremacist worldview, and focuses its attention on the four areas
        in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the most intensely for
        the longest periods of time: in laboratories, in the food industry, in
        the clothing trade, and in the entertainment business. We also work on a
        variety of other issues, including the cruel killing of rodents, birds,
        and other animals who are often considered “pests” as well as cruelty to
        domesticated animals. PETA works through public education, investigative
        newsgathering and reporting, research, animal rescue, legislation,
        special events, celebrity involvement, and protest campaigns.

      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p class="about-story">
        PETA was founded in 1980 and is dedicated to establishing and defending
        the rights of all animals. PETA operates under the simple principle that
        animals are not ours to experiment on, eat, wear, use for entertainment,
        or abuse in any other way. PETA informs policymakers and the public
        about animal abuse and promotes kind treatment of animals. PETA is an
        international nonprofit charitable organization based in Norfolk,
        Virginia, with entities worldwide. PETA believes that animals have
        rights and deserve to have their best interests taken into
        consideration, regardless of whether they are useful to humans. Like
        you, they are capable of suffering and have an interest in leading their
        own lives. The very heart of all of PETA’s actions is the idea that it
        is the right of all beings—human and nonhuman alike—to be free from
        harm. Our world is plagued with many serious problems, all of which
        deserve our attention. Cruelty to animals is one of them. We believe
        that all people should try to stop animal abuse whenever and wherever
        they can. Since 1980, PETA has campaigned to establish a global society
        in which humans consider the needs of what Henry Beston, noted American
        writer and naturalist of the mid-20th century, so beautifully called
        “the other nations.” We uphold the rights of individual animals to be
        respected. For most, that means simply leaving them alone. PETA opposes
        speciesism, a human-supremacist worldview, and focuses its attention on
        the four areas in which the largest numbers of animals suffer the most
        intensely for the longest periods of time: in laboratories, in the food
        industry, in the clothing trade, and in the entertainment business. We
        also work on a variety of other issues, including the cruel killing of
        rodents, birds, and other animals who are often considered “pests” as
        well as cruelty to domesticated animals. In today’s world of virtually
        unlimited choices, animal exploitation is simply unacceptable. We can
        eat better, educate ourselves better, clothe ourselves better, and
        entertain ourselves better without torturing and killing animals. We
        have the power to spare animals excruciating pain by making better
        choices about the food we eat, the things we buy, and the activities we
        support.

          Apple saved my business. I wish I would have thought of it first. We
          can't understand how we've been living without apple. Apple was the
          best investment I ever made.
